What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

A block level element will create a new line for said element, whilst a inline level element will continue along the same line as a previous element.

What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?

Think of your code like a cake, there are many layers. An element that is positioned absolutely can be layed underneath/above other elements without affecting them. you can interact with them without interacting with what's around them.

How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?

For this you can utilize flexbox. With flexbox you can precisely size elements and display them however you want.

Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default, and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

Div, p, nav, span, img, button

In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?

The box model is made up various css properties that allow us to style our elements exactly to our needs. I don't know what the question means by "fix" but the box model includes the content, padding, border, margin.
